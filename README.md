# VB Shopping Cart Project
DISCLAIMER: for this project our class was given a skeleton of an app with a main menu and we had to implement a general login and add functionality for a specific feature; in my case, the shopping Cart ("Shop" section).

This program authenticates users and allows them to add different quantities of searchable items to a cart. After completing a transaction, the users get a report of their pruchase that is then saved in the database.

Th SQL database used in this project contains authorized users, products, and invoices among other things.
